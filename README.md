# Image-Captioning-With-Speech-Synthesis
An end-to-end deep learning project that automatically generates textual captions from input images and converts those captions into human-like speech using integrated speech synthesis. Built using CNN-RNN-based architecture for image captioning and TTS (Text-to-Speech) for speech generation.
